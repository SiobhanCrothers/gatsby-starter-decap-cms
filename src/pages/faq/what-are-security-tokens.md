## What are Security Tokens? 

### Definition

A **Security Token** is a physical or digital device or artifact used to authenticate a user, system, or application. It represents a claim about a subject, often proving the identity or permissions of the bearer. Security tokens can be hardware devices (like smart cards or USB tokens) or digital tokens (like JSON Web Tokens or SAML assertions).

### Types of Security Tokens

1. **Hardware Tokens:** Physical devices that generate one-time passwords (OTP) or have embedded cryptographic keys.
2. **Software Tokens:** Digital representations stored on devices, like smartphones, that generate OTPs or store cryptographic credentials.
3. **Smart Cards:** Physical cards with embedded chips that can process cryptographic functions and store credentials.
4. **Bearer Tokens:** Digital tokens that grant access to whoever possesses them, often used in OAuth scenarios.
5. **JSON Web Tokens (JWT):** Compact, URL-safe tokens that encode claims in JSON format, often used in OIDC.

### Benefits of Security Tokens

1. **Strong Authentication:** Provides a higher level of assurance than just passwords or PINs.
2. **Portability:** Especially for hardware tokens, they can be carried by users and used across multiple systems or locations.
3. **Mitigation of Phishing:** As tokens are not easily replicable like passwords, they reduce the risk of phishing attacks.
4. **Non-repudiation:** With cryptographic tokens, actions taken by users can be tied back to them, ensuring accountability.
5. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Tokens can be used as a part of MFA, combining something you know (password/PIN) with something you have (token).

### Importance in Information Security

- **Reduced Attack Surface:** Security tokens offer an added layer of security, making it more difficult for attackers to gain unauthorized access.
- **Standardized Security:** Many token standards, like JWT or SAML, are widely adopted, promoting interoperability.
- **Enhanced User Trust:** Users often perceive systems with token-based authentication as more secure, enhancing trust.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Certain regulations mandate the use of strong authentication methods, which security tokens can help fulfill.
