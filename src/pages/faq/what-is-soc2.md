## SOC 2

### What is SOC 2?

**Service Organization Control 2 (SOC 2)** is an auditing procedure developed by the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA) that ensures service providers securely manage data to protect the interests and privacy of their clients. Unlike its predecessor, SOC 1 (focused on financial reporting), SOC 2 evaluates controls that specifically relate to the Trust Services Criteria: Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, and Privacy.

### How SOC 2 Relates to IAM

One of the core Trust Services Criteria is Security, and a critical component of security is ensuring appropriate access controls. SOC 2 audits evaluate the effectiveness of IAM practices within an organization, ensuring that they align with established criteria for protecting client data.

### Value of SOC 2 in an IAM Program

1. **Validation of Access Controls:** A SOC 2 audit provides third-party validation that an organization's IAM practices are in line with industry standards.
2. **Enhanced Trust:** Achieving SOC 2 compliance provides assurance to stakeholders and clients that their data is being managed securely.
3. **Continuous Improvement:** Preparing for and undergoing SOC 2 audits encourages organizations to continuously review and improve their IAM practices.
4. **Breach Prevention:** SOC 2's focus on security controls, including IAM, aids in preventing unauthorized data access.
5. **Regulatory Alignment:** For many industries, SOC 2 compliance is either mandatory or highly recommended, making it integral to an organization's overall compliance strategy.

### Importance in Information Security

- **Holistic Security Review:** SOC 2's comprehensive nature ensures all aspects of IAM—from user provisioning to de-provisioning—are scrutinized.
- **Audit Trails:** Ensures that all access and activities related to data are logged and available for review, aiding in incident detection and response.
- **Risk Management:** Through the SOC 2 audit process, potential vulnerabilities in the IAM process can be identified and addressed.
- **Stakeholder Assurance:** Provides clients and stakeholders with confidence in the organization's IAM practices.
- **Business Differentiation:** Achieving SOC 2 compliance can differentiate a business in the market, especially when serving security-conscious industries.
