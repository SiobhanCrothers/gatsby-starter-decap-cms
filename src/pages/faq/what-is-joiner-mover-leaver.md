## What is Joiner/Mover/Leaver (JML)?

### Definition
The **Joiner/Mover/Leaver (JML)** process describes the lifecycle of an employee's or contractor's access rights within an organization:

1. **Joiner:** Refers to the process when a new employee or contractor starts with the organization and needs to be granted initial access rights.
2. **Mover:** Describes when an existing employee or contractor changes roles within the organization, necessitating changes to their access rights.
3. **Leaver:** Refers to the process when an employee or contractor leaves the organization, and their access rights need to be revoked or transferred.

### Key Aspects

1. **Onboarding (Joiner):** Ensuring new employees have the necessary access to systems, data, and facilities to perform their roles.
2. **Transitioning (Mover):** Adjusting access rights based on role changes, promotions, or department shifts.
3. **Offboarding (Leaver):** Revoking access rights and returning company assets when an employee leaves.

### Benefits of Proper JML Management

1. **Security:** Ensures that only current employees with the correct roles have access to sensitive data and systems.
2. **Efficiency:** Streamlined processes reduce the administrative overhead associated with granting, changing, and revoking access.
3. **Compliance:** Many regulations require timely revocation of access for departed employees.
4. **Data Integrity:** Ensures that only appropriately authorized personnel can modify or delete data.
5. **Accountability:** With proper JML processes, actions can be traced back to specific individuals based on their roles.

### Importance in Information Security

- **Principle of Least Privilege:** The JML process ensures that individuals only have the access they need and nothing more.
- **Mitigating Insider Threat:** Timely revocation or modification of access reduces the risk posed by disgruntled employees or those changing roles.
- **Audit Trail:** Provides a clear record of who had access to what, and when, aiding in investigations and audits.
- **Operational Continuity:** Ensures that employees always have the access they need to perform their jobs, reducing downtime and inefficiencies.
