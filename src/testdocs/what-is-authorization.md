## What is Authorization?

### Definition
**Authorization** is the process of determining what actions, resources, or services a user is permitted to access or perform after they have been authenticated. It involves specifying and enforcing policies that dictate which users can access which resources and under what conditions.

### Key Components

1. **Access Control Lists (ACLs):** Lists attached to resources that specify which users or groups can access the resource and what operations they can perform.
2. **Roles:** Defined sets of permissions that can be assigned to users or groups. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a common method of implementing authorization.
3. **Policies:** Rules that determine access permissions based on criteria like user roles, attributes, or context.
4. **Attributes:** Characteristics or properties of users, systems, or environments that can be used in Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) to determine permissions.

### Authorization Process

1. A user is authenticated, confirming their identity.
2. The system checks predefined rules or policies to determine what resources the authenticated user can access.
3. The system grants or denies access based on these rules or policies.

### Benefits of Proper Authorization

1. **Data Protection:** Ensures that sensitive data is only accessible by those with the appropriate permissions.
2. **Principle of Least Privilege:** Users are only granted the permissions necessary to perform their job functions, reducing potential damage from breaches or misuse.
3. **Auditability:** Authorization mechanisms provide logs and trails that can be used to review and audit access patterns.
4. **Regulatory Compliance:** Proper authorization helps organizations meet regulatory requirements related to data access and protection.
5. **Operational Integrity:** By ensuring users can only access and modify data and systems within their purview, the risk of unintentional disruptions or mistakes is reduced.

### Importance in Information Security

- **Boundary Enforcement:** Authorization acts as a boundary, ensuring users can't access systems or data outside their permissions.
- **Security Posture Enhancement:** Proper authorization is a key pillar in a robust security posture, complementing other security mechanisms.
- **Threat Mitigation:** Reduces the potential impact of threats by limiting what authenticated users can access or modify.
- **Accountability:** By tracking and logging authorization decisions, systems can hold users accountable for their actions.
