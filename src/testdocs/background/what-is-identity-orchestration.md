## What is Identity Orchestration?

### Definition
**Identity Orchestration** refers to the coordinated management and automation of various identity and access management (IAM) processes across an organization's systems and platforms. It involves designing, implementing, and managing workflows that handle identity-related tasks in a streamlined and efficient manner.

### Key Components

1. **Orchestration Engine:** The central system or platform that coordinates and automates identity workflows.
2. **Connectors/Adapters:** Interfaces that allow the orchestration engine to communicate with various IAM systems, directories, and applications.
3. **Policies and Rules:** Defined criteria that guide how identity-related decisions are made and tasks are executed.

### Identity Orchestration Processes

1. **Provisioning:** Automated creation, updating, or deletion of user accounts across systems.
2. **Authentication:** Coordinating multi-factor authentication processes or integrating various authentication methods.
3. **Authorization:** Managing user permissions and access rights across diverse systems.
4. **Auditing and Reporting:** Consolidating logs and reports from various IAM systems to provide a holistic view of identity activities.

### Benefits of Identity Orchestration

1. **Efficiency:** Automates and streamlines IAM processes, reducing manual tasks and potential errors.
2. **Consistency:** Ensures uniform application of identity policies across the organization.
3. **Flexibility:** Easily integrate new systems or adapt to changing requirements without significant redesign or reconfiguration.
4. **Enhanced Security:** Centralized management can lead to more consistent and robust security policies.
5. **Reduced Complexity:** Provides a unified interface for managing identity across a multitude of systems and platforms.

### Importance in Information Security

- **Centralized Management:** Identity orchestration centralizes the management of diverse IAM systems, leading to better oversight and control.
- **Rapid Response:** Automated workflows allow for quick adjustments in response to security incidents or changing requirements.
- **Auditability:** Consolidated logging and reporting enhance the ability to audit and review identity-related activities.
- **Adaptability:** Facilitates easier integration of new technologies or systems into the IAM ecosystem.
