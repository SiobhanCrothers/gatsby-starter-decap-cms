## What is Single Sign-On (SSO)?

### Definition
**Single Sign-On (SSO)** is an authentication process that allows a user to access multiple applications or services with a single set of credentials. Once authenticated into one application, the user can access others without being prompted to log in again.

### Key Components

1. **Identity Provider (IdP):** The trusted system responsible for verifying user identity and providing authentication assertions to other systems.
2. **Service Providers (SPs):** Applications or services that rely on the IdP for user authentication.
3. **SSO Protocol:** The method for transmitting authentication information, such as SAML, OAuth, or OpenID Connect.

### SSO Workflow

1. A user logs into an application, which communicates with the central IdP.
2. The IdP authenticates the user and issues a token or assertion.
3. As the user attempts to access other integrated applications, the SSO system uses the token to grant access without requiring another login.

### Benefits of Single Sign-On

1. **User Convenience:** Reduces the number of passwords users must remember and manage.
2. **Increased Productivity:** Reduces the time users spend logging into multiple applications.
3. **Reduced Helpdesk Costs:** Fewer password reset requests and login-related issues lead to reduced support costs.
4. **Enhanced Security:** Centralized authentication allows for more robust security measures, like multi-factor authentication.
5. **Consistent Authentication Experience:** Users have a uniform login process across various applications.

### Importance in Information Security

- **Reduced Attack Surface:** Fewer passwords mean fewer potential points of failure.
- **Audit and Compliance:** Centralized authentication simplifies the process of tracking and auditing user access.
- **Streamlined User Management:** Centralized authentication makes it easier to onboard, manage, and offboard users.
- **Data Protection:** SSO can be combined with other security measures to ensure data is accessed only by authenticated and authorized users.
