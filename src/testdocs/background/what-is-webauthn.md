## What is Webauthn?

### Definition
**WebAuthn** (Web Authentication) is a web standard introduced by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) for password-less and multi-factor user authentication. It leverages public key cryptography and allows users to authenticate with biometrics, mobile devices, or FIDO2 security keys, eliminating the need for passwords.

### Key Aspects

1. **Client-to-Authenticator Protocol (CTAP):** Works in tandem with WebAuthn to enable external devices, like security keys or mobiles, to work with browsers and platforms for authentication.
2. **Platform-agnostic:** WebAuthn is designed to work with any platform or device that understands the protocol.
3. **Cryptographically Secure:** Uses public key cryptography to ensure security during user authentication.

### WebAuthn Process

1. The relying party (typically a website or web application) generates a challenge.
2. The user's device or authenticator creates a new public-private key pair.
3. The public key and a signature over the challenge and some other data are sent back to the relying party.
4. The relying party verifies the signature, ensuring the authentication is genuine.

### Benefits of WebAuthn

1. **Password-less Authentication:** Reduces the risks associated with password breaches and simplifies the user experience.
2. **Phishing Prevention:** Cryptographic login prevents attackers from stealing user credentials.
3. **Universal:** Supports a wide range of authenticators, including biometrics, mobile devices, and hardware tokens.
4. **Enhanced User Experience:** Users benefit from a smoother, faster, and more secure authentication process without needing to remember passwords.
5. **Reduced Dependency on Passwords:** Organizations can lower the costs and risks associated with password resets, breaches, and support.

### Importance in Information Security

- **Mitigate Common Attacks:** WebAuthn helps protect against phishing, man-in-the-middle, and replay attacks.
- **Strengthened Security Posture:** By providing strong authentication methods, organizations can enhance their overall security posture.
- **Promotion of Best Practices:** Encourages the adoption of strong, user-friendly authentication methods across the web.
