## What is Identity Brokering?

### Definition
**Identity Brokering** refers to the process of managing and mediating identity information between multiple identity providers and service providers. An identity broker acts as an intermediary, translating authentication requests and responses between different systems, protocols, or standards.

### Key Components

1. **Identity Broker:** The intermediary system or service that handles identity transactions between identity providers and service providers.
2. **Identity Providers (IdPs):** Systems or platforms that authenticate and provide identity assertions.
3. **Service Providers (SPs):** Systems or applications that rely on the IdP (or broker) for authentication and authorization decisions.

### Identity Brokering Flow

1. A user attempts to access a service or application (the SP).
2. If the user is not authenticated, the SP redirects the request to the identity broker.
3. The identity broker determines the appropriate IdP for authentication.
4. The user is redirected to the chosen IdP for authentication.
5. Upon successful authentication, the IdP sends an assertion to the identity broker.
6. The identity broker translates and forwards the assertion to the SP.
7. The SP grants access to the user based on the received assertion.

### Benefits of Identity Brokering

1. **Simplified Integration:** Reduces the complexity of integrating multiple IdPs and SPs, especially when they use different authentication protocols.
2. **Single Sign-On (SSO):** Users can authenticate once and gain access to multiple services or applications.
3. **Enhanced Security:** Provides a centralized point for security policies, logging, and monitoring.
4. **Flexibility:** Easily integrate new applications or services without needing to reconfigure or modify existing integrations.
5. **Improved User Experience:** Users encounter consistent authentication flows regardless of the underlying protocols or standards.

### Importance in Information Security

- **Consistent Security Policies:** Centralized brokering ensures uniform security and authentication policies across multiple services.
- **Reduced Attack Surface:** By centralizing authentication, potential vulnerabilities in individual SPs can be mitigated.
- **Audit and Compliance:** Provides a single point for tracking, auditing, and reporting on user access across multiple services.
- **Protocol Translation:** Allows for seamless integration even when IdPs and SPs use different authentication protocols or standards.
