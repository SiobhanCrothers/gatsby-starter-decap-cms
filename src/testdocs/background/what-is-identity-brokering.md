## What is Identity Brokering?

### Definition
**Identity Brokering** refers to a process where an intermediary (the broker) manages identity assertions and translations between multiple parties, often in scenarios involving Single Sign-On (SSO) across different domains or platforms. The broker acts as a trusted mediator, authenticating users with their home domain and passing on the necessary identity assertions to third-party services or applications.

### Key Components

1. **Identity Provider (IdP):** The service or platform responsible for authenticating users and issuing identity assertions.
2. **Service Provider (SP):** The third-party application or service that relies on the broker to authenticate users.
3. **Broker:** The intermediary that communicates between the IdP and SP, translating and forwarding identity assertions.

### Identity Brokering Workflow

1. A user attempts to access a third-party service (SP).
2. The SP redirects the user to the identity broker.
3. The broker directs the user to their home domain or IdP for authentication.
4. After successful authentication, the IdP sends an assertion to the broker.
5. The broker translates (if necessary) and forwards the assertion to the SP, granting the user access.

### Benefits of Identity Brokering

1. **Single Sign-On (SSO):** Users can access multiple applications or services without re-authenticating, improving user experience.
2. **Interoperability:** Allows for seamless authentication across different platforms, domains, or technologies.
3. **Centralized Management:** Provides a central point for managing identity assertions and translations, simplifying administrative overhead.
4. **Enhanced Security:** By centralizing the authentication process, it's easier to implement security enhancements like Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) or monitor for suspicious activities.
5. **Scalability:** Easily integrates new applications or services without the need to modify existing authentication mechanisms.

### Importance in Information Security

- **Reduced Attack Surface:** Centralized authentication processes can reduce potential points of vulnerability.
- **Auditability:** A centralized broker can provide comprehensive logs and records of authentication activities across multiple platforms.
- **Data Minimization:** The broker can ensure only the necessary identity information is passed to third-party services.
- **Adaptability:** As security requirements evolve, changes can be implemented at the broker level without impacting individual service providers.
