## What is OpenID Connect?

### Definition
**OpenID Connect (OIDC)** is a modern authentication protocol built on top of the OAuth 2.0 authorization framework. While OAuth 2.0 is designed for authorization (granting apps permissions to access data), OIDC adds a layer that enables authentication (proving user identity).

### Key Components

1. **ID Token:** A JSON Web Token (JWT) that contains claims about the authenticated user.
2. **UserInfo Endpoint:** A protected resource that returns claims about the authenticated user.
3. **Client:** The application requesting the authentication, typically a web or mobile app.
4. **Authorization Server:** The server that authenticates the user and issues ID tokens.

### OIDC Flow

1. The client redirects the user to the authorization server.
2. After authenticating, the user is asked to grant the requested permissions.
3. Upon approval, the authorization server redirects the user back to the client with an ID token.
4. The client can extract user information from the ID token or query the UserInfo Endpoint for additional claims.

### Benefits of OpenID Connect

1. **Standardized Authentication:** OIDC provides a standardized way of authenticating users across various platforms and applications.
2. **Single Sign-On (SSO):** OIDC enables users to log in once and access multiple applications without re-authenticating.
3. **Security:** Utilizes modern security mechanisms like JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and can be combined with other security measures like Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
4. **Scalability:** OIDC can be implemented across large ecosystems, supporting various clients and resource servers.
5. **User Experience:** Streamlines the login process, reducing friction for end-users.

### Importance in Information Security

- **Identity Assurance:** OIDC provides a reliable method to confirm the identity of users.
- **Data Minimization:** Clients can request only the specific user data they need.
- **Token-Based:** The use of tokens reduces the need for password-based authentication, minimizing certain risks.
- **Interoperability:** As an open standard, OIDC can be implemented across a wide range of systems, promoting secure interoperability.
