## Webhook email service

This tutorial will guide you through how you can extend Bravura Cloud with your own notification systems. Its intended to introduce how webhook notifications can be easily leveraged to accomplish a common task like sending emails. Adopters of Bravura Cloud are encouraged to build upon this example with other service they may need. For example, pushing data into a SIEM system. Alerting people to changes in sensitive groups. Alerting to out of bounds changes.
