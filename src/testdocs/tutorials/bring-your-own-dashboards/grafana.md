## Bring your own Dashboards via Grafana

For companies who are already familiar with Grafana dashborads, you can quickly and easily integrate Bravura Clouds data into those dashboards. For example:

* Extend your security operations center dashboards with Identity risks and events. 
* Extend your governance dashboards with identity inventory data
* Extend your existing compliance dashbaords with any new compliance failures

Integrating this involves leveraging Grafana's built in support for graphql data sources.
