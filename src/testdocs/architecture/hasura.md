## Hasura

### What is Hasura?

**Hasura** is an open-source engine that connects to databases and microservices and instantly provides a GraphQL API backend. It's known for its high performance and real-time capabilities. One of Hasura's standout features is its fine-grained access control system, which can be used to define permissions at various levels.

### How Hasura Relates to IAM

Hasura's built-in fine-grained access control can play a significant role in IAM, especially in scenarios where GraphQL API access needs to be controlled based on user roles, attributes, or other criteria. Through its dynamic access control, Hasura provides a way to specify who can access what data and under which conditions.

### Value of Hasura in an IAM Program

1. **Fine-Grained Access Control:** Hasura allows for the definition of precise access controls at the field, row, or operation level within the GraphQL API.
2. **Role-Based Permissions:** Hasura supports role-based access control, enabling permissions to be set based on user roles defined within the IAM system.
3. **Dynamic Data Access:** With Hasura, permissions can be defined based on request input or user session variables, allowing for dynamic and contextual access controls.
4. **Integration with JWT & Webhooks:** Hasura can integrate with existing IAM systems by using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or webhooks for authentication and authorization.
5. **Auditability:** Hasura logs can be integrated into monitoring solutions to track and audit access to the GraphQL API, enhancing transparency and compliance.

### Importance in Information Security

- **Secure Data Exposure:** With Hasura's granular permissions, organizations can ensure that they're only exposing data that users are authorized to access.
- **Flexibility:** Hasura's permissions system is highly flexible, allowing it to adapt to complex and evolving IAM requirements.
- **Consistent Policy Enforcement:** By centralizing access control in Hasura, organizations can ensure consistent enforcement of security policies across their GraphQL API.
- **Reduced Development Overhead:** Hasura's built-in access controls reduce the need for custom development, ensuring that security best practices are consistently applied.
