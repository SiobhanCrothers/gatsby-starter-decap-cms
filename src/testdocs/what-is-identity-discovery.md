## Identity Discovery

### What is Identity Discovery?

**Identity Discovery** is the process of identifying and cataloging all the digital identities associated with an organization's users, employees, contractors, and other stakeholders. This includes accounts, roles, permissions, and access rights across various systems and applications.

### Key Objectives:

1. **Comprehensive Visibility:** Gain a complete view of all digital identities within the organization.
2. **Effective Governance:** Ensure identities are managed in accordance with policies and standards.
3. **Security Enhancement:** Identify and rectify unauthorized or excessive access rights.

### Steps in Identity Discovery:

1. **Data Collection:** Gather information from various sources, such as user directories, databases, applications, and access logs.
2. **Data Consolidation:** Centralize identity data into a single repository for analysis and management.
3. **Analysis:** Review identity data to identify duplicates, inconsistencies, and unauthorized access.
4. **Mapping:** Map identities to roles, permissions, and systems to understand access relationships.
5. **Documentation:** Maintain accurate records of discovered identities and their associated attributes.

### Benefits of Identity Discovery:

- **Risk Reduction:** Identifying unauthorized or excessive access rights helps mitigate security risks.
- **Compliance:** Ensuring accurate records of identities aids in meeting regulatory requirements.
- **Efficient IAM:** Comprehensive visibility streamlines user provisioning and de-provisioning processes.
- **Reduced Access Costs:** Identifying unused or redundant identities can lead to cost savings.
- **Improved Auditing:** Accurate identity data supports audits, investigations, and reporting.

### Importance in Information Security:

- **Access Control:** Identity discovery is crucial for maintaining proper access controls and preventing unauthorized access.
- **Data Protection:** Accurate identity data ensures that only authorized users have access to sensitive information.
- **Comprehensive Governance:** Identity discovery supports effective governance and compliance by maintaining accurate records of access rights.
